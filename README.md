Hello, I'm Nathaniel Stokes (You can call me Nathan though).</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this written in Java, HTML, C#, C++, Python? 
I'm guessing <i>HTML</i>? This is an expariment for myself so don't be discouraged if it doesn't strike your fancy.</br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm taking the beginning steps into becoming more focused on development, currently I wrote a java game with a friend
in highschool, worked on a friends personal business ebay pressence (mastering <b><i>HTML</b></i> along the way), I fully intigrated
an intuitive personal excel commission sheet(VBA) while I was working as an insurance producer with an agent from State Farm. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandfather worked at IBM as a quality inspector and told me, when I was young, one of the most frustrating things that had
happened to him was when errors became coded and troubleshooting boiled down to following commands on a prompt. "Back in the good
days, each problem was another puzzle I got to dive into and understand. Now we just do whatever the computer tells us we have to 
do."
I've started taking classes at BYU-Idaho to get my bacholers in software development and am working in a Data Science Bootcamp through TripleTen.
